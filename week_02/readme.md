# Hunting and Gathering - Modular Typeface 
## Week 02


Today in class, we opened the day by huntering and gathering examples of moldular typefaces and showing these off in a [*Google Slide*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2hAFp6si7UsVuPj1oMQ21_HHF858NbXZna0YQxOQio/edit#slide=id.p). Some of the found letterforms included epic, generative brutalist styles from Tais Ghelli, to contemporary and simplified forms from Ahn Sang Soo Mano and Logan Dufrn.

While it wasn't necessary to have a digitally created typeface, the artist I selected is a linoleum artist. [*Leonie Staman*](https://www.detoffetoko.nl/leonie-staman) 3D prints her alphabet and manually traces these to create type inspired by the Spirograph techique most children will remember recieving as gifts from the 90's-00's.
